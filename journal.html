		<p> 2/4/21 | Hello! This is my first journal entry. So far I've learned how to anchor tag other web pages to my own, how to stylize things to fit my aesthetic choices, and how to push my code onto the internet. The main thing that has been difficult for me so far has been being decisive. I've been having trouble coming up with a single comprehensive vision for what I want my website and codesketches to look like, so I'm going to try and be more chill about it, and see where my gut takes me.
		I'm enjoying coding, though. I'd done a bit for robotics here and there, but to be quite frank, all that coding was not nearly as enjoyable as this is. Coding in this class feels more personal than much else of what I do for other classes. Of course, it's not as if masses of people will be flocking to my website, but still, the act of making personal choices which display themselves on the internet (live) is a bit thrilling. Or maybe scary. Which is a hypocritical thing to say, when social media devours our lives.  </p>

		<p> 3/2/21 | OK, I am amazed that it is already March. Today I had a great lab with Ms. J, and in it we discussed my recent bad-fortune-teller codesketch. I'm going to try and summarize what my code for <a href = "bookfortunecodesketch.html"> this </a> specific project does here, in my journal. Alrighty. So first, I defined a few variables in javascript, linking them back to divs that I had already established in html. Then, I created an array called "sasiness" with all of my bad fortunes in it. My first function, "changeUp", begins by creating a variable of "randomNumber." randomNumber is generated by multiplying a random number (that exists within the realm of math) with my the length of my array of Sasiness, which is essentially the number of components that are held within sasiness, the number currently being 19. Then, this value is rounded (I think) when it is multiplied by Math.floor. Next, I created a new variable, "fortunetext", which is equal to a random string chosen from my array of sasiness. The final significant part of this function changes the inner text of my textbox, currently entitled "zoltar", to a string selected by fortune text. Outside of the function, I have a few event listeners which change zoltar's inner text when you click either on the larger page or the "turn page" pink box. </p>
