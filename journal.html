		<p> 2/4/21 | Hello! This is my first journal entry. So far I've learned how to anchor tag other web pages to my own, how to stylize things to fit my aesthetic choices, and how to push my code onto the internet. The main thing that has been difficult for me so far has been being decisive. I've been having trouble coming up with a single comprehensive vision for what I want my website and codesketches to look like, so I'm going to try and be more chill about it, and see where my gut takes me.
		I'm enjoying coding, though. I'd done a bit for robotics here and there, but to be quite frank, all that coding was not nearly as enjoyable as this is. Coding in this class feels more personal than much else of what I do for other classes. Of course, it's not as if masses of people will be flocking to my website, but still, the act of making personal choices which display themselves on the internet (live) is a bit thrilling. Or maybe scary. Which is a hypocritical thing to say, when social media devours our lives.  </p>
